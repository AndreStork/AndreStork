# AndreStork's GitHub Page
Hi, I'm Andrea (or Andre if you want), a 16 years old guy from Italy who loves tech and cute things, I'm not really good at programming but I can manage to do HTML stuff and some ðŸŒŠðŸ”ª. I also play a lot of osu! and, even though I really suck, I always find it pretty fun, [you can check my profile if you want](https://strkln.tk/osu).
