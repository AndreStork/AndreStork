# AndreStork's GitHub Page
Hi, I'm Andrea (or Andre if you want), a 16 years old guy from Italy who loves tech and cute things, I'm not really good at programming but I can manage to do some stuff when I have the perseverance. I'm also a casual gamer and (now occasional) [osu! player](https://strkln.tk/osu).

### My skills on which I suck too
